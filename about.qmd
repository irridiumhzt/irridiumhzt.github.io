I am a year 3 architecture student in NUS. 

### This data story aims to address:
1. Which country is the most LGBT friendly within Europe? 
2. Is there a difference across the different subgroups? (Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender)
This would be achieved using Visualisation and analysis of survey data via Shiny, ggplot2 and other functions within Rstudio.

## Why it matters 
With Pink tourism on the rise, Europe is fast becoming one of the most popular travel destinations in the world. With higher purchasing power and willingness to spend, the LGBT community  more revenues for the host countries. 

According to a survey conducted in the U.S. by Harris Interactive, LGBT adults report that on average they intended to spend $1300 between May and August 2021 for leisure, while the average planned expenditure is $1058. As such, being perceived as LGBT friendly would be a huge pulling factor for attracting LGBT tourists.


## Shift in Attitude is needed?
That being said, discrimination against LGBT community is still prevalent even among members of LGBT community, making life worse for the non-binary and transgender minority, as they are disproportionately targeted in hate crimes. 

According to the FBI's Hate Crime Statistics, transgender individuals, particularly transgender women of colour, are at a higher risk of experiencing violent hate crimes in the United States. I would like to investigate to what extent this is true in Europe.

## How far have we gone?
Below illustrates a more recent survey done in 2022. Can you spot any difference in terms of countries' ranking?
