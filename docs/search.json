With higher purchasing power and willingness to spend, the LGBT community more revenues for the host countries.\nAccording to a survey conducted in the U.S. by Harris Interactive, LGBT adults report that on average they intended to spend $1300 between May and August 2021 for leisure, while the average planned expenditure is $1058. As such, being perceived as LGBT friendly would be a huge pulling factor for attracting LGBT tourists."

Could you please specify whether it is very rare, fairly rare, fairly widespread or very widespread for discrimination to occur in the country where you live?\n\n\nWarning: In subset.data.frame(survey_clean, CountryCode = \"Average\") :\n extra argument 'CountryCode' will be disregarded\n\n\n\n\n\n###2. How widespread are casual jokes in everyday life about LGBT?\n\n\nWarning: In subset.data.frame(survey_clean, CountryCode = \"Average\") :\n extra argument 'CountryCode' will be disregarded\n\n\n\n\n\n###3. Have you been open about you being L, G, B or T?\n\n\nWarning: In subset.data.frame(survey_clean, CountryCode = \"Average\") :\n extra argument 'CountryCode' will be disregarded\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nWhile discrimination rating follows a normal distribution with the mean in the middle (It occurs sometimes), the result for casual jokes is barely skewed (it is fairly widespread). This illustrates that people still perceive LGBT community differently, and could possibly justify why only on average 7% of the surveyees are open in EU countries.\n\n3. All things considered, how satisfied would you say you are with your life these days?\n \nConclusion\nOverall, the three most LGBT friendly countries in EU are Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Denmark.\nFor Gay men, the most friendly country in EU is Luxembourg.\nFor Lesbian women, the most friendly country in EU is the Netherlands.\nFor Bisexual men, the most friendly country in EU is the Netherlands.\nFor Bisexual women, the most friendly country in EU is the Austria.\nFor Transgender individuals, the most friendly country is the Spain."
