    "text": "Why it matters\nWith Pink tourism on the rise, Europe is fast becoming one of the most popular travel destinations in the world. With higher purchasing power and willingness to spend, the LGBT community more revenues for the host countries.\nAccording to a survey conducted in the U.S. by Harris Interactive, LGBT adults report that on average they intended to spend $1300 between May and August 2021 for leisure, while the average planned expenditure is $1058. As such, being perceived as LGBT friendly would be a huge pulling factor for attracting LGBT tourists."

I would like to investigate to what extent this is true in Europe."

Have you been open about you being L, G, B or T?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll things considered, how satisfied would you say you are with your life these days?\n\n \nConclusion\nWhile discrimination rating follows a normal distribution with the mean in the middle (It occurs sometimes), the result for casual jokes is barely skewed (it is fairly widespread). This illustrates that people still perceive LGBT community differently, and could possibly justify why only on average 7% of the surveyees are open in EU countries.\nOverall, the three most LGBT friendly countries in EU are Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Denmark.\nFor Gay men, the most friendly country in EU is Luxembourg.\nFor Lesbian women, the most friendly country in EU is the Netherlands.\nFor Bisexual men, the most friendly country in EU is the Netherlands.\nFor Bisexual women, the most friendly country in EU is the Austria.\nFor Transgender individuals, the most friendly country is the Spain."
